# RHT-tt

Main changes were made in the `sections/main-product.liquid` file.

The task was to implement a swiper (image slider) for the product page with configurable options via the schema. The following features were added:

- Ability to enable or disable pagination
- Ability to set the number of visible slides
- Automatic image sorting based on the selected color swatch
